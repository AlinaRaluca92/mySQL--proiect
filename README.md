# Database Project for Bookster

The objective of this project is to utilize the SQL expertise acquired during the Software Testing course and implement it practically. 

The application under examination is Bookster.

The tools employed include MySQL Workbench.



#### Database Description: Bookster Book Management System

The Bookster Book Management System database is designed to facilitate the management of books and related data for the Bookster application. It serves as a centralized repository for storing and organizing information about books, authors, genres, user reviews, and other relevant entities.

General Information Stored:

Books: Details of individual books, including title, author(s), ISBN, publication date, genre, publisher, and availability status.

Authors: Information about authors, such as name, biography, nationality, and a list of books authored.

Genres: Classification of books into different genres or categories, allowing users to browse and search for books based on their interests.

User Reviews: User-generated reviews and ratings for books, providing feedback and recommendations to other users.
Users: Data about users of the Bookster application, including personal information (name, email, password), preferences, and reading history.

Bookshelves: Virtual bookshelves maintained by users to organize and track their collections of books, with options for categorization and customization.

Other Relevant Information:

The database supports features such as book search, browsing, and recommendation algorithms to help users discover new books based on their interests and preferences.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have successfully designed and implemented a database schema for an online bookstore application.
We created tables for authors, books, customers, orders, and order_items, establishing relationships between them where necessary.
Using DML statements, we populated the tables with sample data to simulate real-world scenarios.
DQL statements were employed to retrieve and analyze data from the database, ensuring the correctness of the results.
Additionally, the execution report from reverse engineering provides insights into the database structure and performance metrics, aiding in further optimization if necessary.
