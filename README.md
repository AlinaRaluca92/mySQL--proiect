## Conclusion

In this project, we have successfully designed and implemented a database schema for an online bookstore application.
We created tables for authors, books, customers, orders, and order_items, establishing relationships between them where necessary.
Using DML statements, we populated the tables with sample data to simulate real-world scenarios.
DQL statements were employed to retrieve and analyze data from the database, ensuring the correctness of the results.
Additionally, the execution report from reverse engineering provides insights into the database structure and performance metrics, aiding in further optimization if necessary.
